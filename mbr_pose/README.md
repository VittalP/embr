## Setup

In order to run the demo correctly:

1. Download Yang & Ramanan's pose estimation code from [here](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dramanan/software/pose/).
2. Copy the *contents* of the directory 'code-full' from the above source into the embr/mbr_pose directory and compile it (instructions to comile can be found in their readme).
3. Download the contents of DivMBest_pose from the following source (link to DivMBest repository) and place it in embr/mbr_pose directory.
4. The results presented in the publiction can now be replicated by running the 'demo_pose_estimation.m' script.
